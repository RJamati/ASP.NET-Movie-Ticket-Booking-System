# ASP.NET-Movie-Ticket-Booking-System

This repo contains the ASP .NET code for a movie ticket booking ststem.

The web app allows you to create new listings for movies, showcase existing movies, and allows you to create bookings with the option to select which cinema and seat you would like.

You can create multiple screens with different seating layouts. Once a seat has been booked, newer bookings will display that seat as unavailable.
